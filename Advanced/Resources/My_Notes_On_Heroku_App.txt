My experience with Heroic:

1) I always create a temporary email to signup with heroic. Remember tempail.com is blocked.
2) Then you'll receive a confirmation email to the temp mail to confirm. Once you do that, you'll be re-directed to the dashboard. Don't close this window.
3) Now, you need to authenticate from cli using: "heroku auth:login". This should ideally open a tab in the default browser, asking you to authenticate by just clicking on a button.
4) If it did not re-direct, you'll still find the URL in the terminal, which you can copy and paste.
5) Now, you need to do some git commands from VS Code.
6) git init --> To initialise heroku's git
7) git create <Unique_app_name>
8) (Optional) git config:set --app=<Unique_app_name> key1=value1 key2=value2
9) git add . --> Stage all changes to heroku's git
10) git commit -m "Commit_Message" --> Commit changes to heroku's git
11) git push heroku master

Debugging:
- When the log says build dependencies are missing, that means it is unable to locate the package-lock.josn and package.json files. And in my experience it means heroku is looking in the parent folder. All you have to do is repeat steps from 6 to 11.
- Try to remove devDependencies for any other error.
